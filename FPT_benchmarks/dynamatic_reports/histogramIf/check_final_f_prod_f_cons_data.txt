New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB2, BB3)

Consumer of type LLVM Phi!!


		 Triggering the normal non-loop addSuppress case!!!!

	 The finalized f_prod =  1 


	 The finalized f_cons =  1 


	 Don't need to add a SUPPRESS!!



======================================================


New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB5, BB3)

Consumer of type LLVM Phi!!


		 Triggering the backward edge case when the consumer is LLVM PHI_ !!!!

		 Printing the SOP of the SUPP in this case! The condition is opposite to SUPPRESS!!:
 C5 &  + 


	Inside applyShannon

	Printing the f_supp after converting it to string
1 + 


F_SUPP is a single condition!!
	The condition is not inverted!!

	 Not printing the Boolean expressions since we are in a case of LLVM PHI!!
