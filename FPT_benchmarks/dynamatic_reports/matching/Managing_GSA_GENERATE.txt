	Starting a new LSQ!!!!



============================================

The control dependencies before modifications are:  
ProducerBB: BB3  has the following modified control dependencies:     2,

ConsumerBB: BB2  has the following modified control dependencies:     Has no modified control dependencies!!

	New (Producer,Consumer) pair:
ProducerBB: BB3  has the following modified control dependencies:     2,

ConsumerBB: BB2  has the following modified control dependencies:     Has no modified control dependencies!!

The outcome of negating the product number 0is: 	 not C2 +  &

	Let's check what came out!!


Need to insert a MUX with:  condition = 2

	Right before calling applyShannon, the size of f_gen is: 1

	Inside applyShannon

********* Inside get_binary_string_minterms *******************
	Printing the minterms_only_in_binary with dontcare bits:
0

	Printing the f_supp after converting it to string
0 + 


**********************************************


Printing the funct_vec of the expression initially
not C2 &  + 



Inside hasMultipleVariables!

The list of var_index of these variables is: 
1, 
The size of present_variables is: 1
Leaving hasMultipleVariables!

Not many variables to do Shannon's!

F_SUPP is a single condition!!
	The condition is inverted!!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	Will insert a MUX in BB3 and the consumer Bx is 2
