------------------------------------------

I just entered returnSELCond!!
BBIndex is 0
BB number is bbID= 1
The LLVM branch node of this BB is called: "brCst_block1" of type type = "Constant in BasicBlock number bbID= 1 has 1 predecessors
The icmp node that will provide the condition for SEL_ALWAYS is: "icmp_0" of type type = "Operator in BasicBlock number bbID= 1
I'm leaving returnSELCond!!



--------------------------------
It turns out that SEL_ALWAYS is composed of just a single condition coming from the enode called: "icmp_0" of type type = "Operator in BasicBlock number bbID= 1 and it should NOT be inverted!!


I just calculated the SEL_NO_TOKEN and will pass it to Shannon's!
