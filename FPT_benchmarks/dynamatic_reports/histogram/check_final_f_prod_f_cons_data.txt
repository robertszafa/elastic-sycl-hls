======================================================


New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB2, BB3)

Consumer of type LLVM Phi!!


		 Triggering the normal non-loop addSuppress case!!!!

	 The finalized f_prod =  1 


	 The finalized f_cons =  1 


	 Don't need to add a SUPPRESS!!



======================================================


New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB3, BB3)

Consumer of type LLVM Phi!!


		 Triggering the backward edge case when the consumer is LLVM PHI_ !!!!

		 Printing the SOP of the SUPP in this case! The condition is opposite to SUPPRESS!!:
 C3 &  + 


	Inside applyShannon

	Printing the f_supp after converting it to string
1 + 


F_SUPP is a single condition!!
	The condition is not inverted!!

	 Not printing the Boolean expressions since we are in a case of LLVM PHI!!

======================================================


New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB2, BB3)

Consumer of type LLVM Phi!!


		 Triggering the normal non-loop addSuppress case!!!!

	 The finalized f_prod =  1 


	 The finalized f_cons =  1 


	 Don't need to add a SUPPRESS!!



======================================================


New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB1, BB4)

Consumer of type LLVM Phi!!


	 Inserted a virtualBB between BB1 and BB4


		 Triggering the normal non-loop addSuppress case!!!!

	 The finalized f_prod =  1 


	 The finalized f_cons =  not C1 &  + 


	 Add a SUPPRESS with f_supp = 
 C1 &  + 


	Right before calling applyShannon, the size of f_supp is: 1

	Inside applyShannon

	Printing the f_supp after converting it to string
1 + 


F_SUPP is a single condition!!
	The condition is not inverted!!


======================================================


New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB3, BB4)

Consumer of type LLVM Phi!!


	 Inserted a virtualBB between BB3 and BB4


		 Triggering the more_prod_than_cons case!!!!

	The consumer deps before calling addLoopsExitstoDeps_ProdInConsOut are: 
****************Inside FindLoopExits_ProdInConsOut*********

	Starting a new loop in the loop nest containing the producerBB!!

	The consumer is not inside this loop!!

	The loop exits of this loop are: BB3 , 


	 The finalized f_prod =  1 


	 The finalized f_cons =  not C3 &  + 


	 Add a SUPPRESS with f_supp = 
 C3 &  + 


	Right before calling applyShannon, the size of f_supp is: 1

	Inside applyShannon

	Printing the f_supp after converting it to string
1 + 


F_SUPP is a single condition!!
	The condition is not inverted!!


======================================================


New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB1, BB3)

Consumer of type type = "Merge!!


		 Triggering the normal non-loop addSuppress case!!!!

	 The finalized f_prod =  1 


	 The finalized f_cons =  C1 &  + 


	 Add a SUPPRESS with f_supp = 
 not C1 &  + 


	Right before calling applyShannon, the size of f_supp is: 1

	Inside applyShannon

	Printing the f_supp after converting it to string
0 + 


F_SUPP is a single condition!!
	The condition is inverted!!


======================================================


New (Producer,Consumer) pair: (BB3, BB3)

Consumer of type type = "Merge!!


		 Triggering the producer == consumer case!!!!

	 NEW DEUBUG INFO: The original producer is in BB1

	 The finalized f_prod =  1 


	 The finalized f_cons =  C3 &  + 


	 Add a SUPPRESS with f_supp = 
 not C3 &  + 


	Right before calling applyShannon, the size of f_supp is: 1

	Inside applyShannon

	Printing the f_supp after converting it to string
