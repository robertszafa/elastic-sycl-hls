I just entered returnSELCond!!
BBIndex is 1
BB number is bbID= 2
The LLVM branch node of this BB is called: "brCst_block2" of type type = "Constant in BasicBlock number bbID= 2 has 1 predecessors
The icmp node that will provide the condition for SEL_ALWAYS is: "icmp_18" of type type = "Operator in BasicBlock number bbID= 2
I'm leaving returnSELCond!!



--------------------------------
It turns out that SEL_ALWAYS is composed of just a single condition coming from the enode called: "icmp_18" of type type = "Operator in BasicBlock number bbID= 2 and it should be inverted!!


I just calculated the SEL_NO_TOKEN and will pass it to Shannon's!
